Session 1 Experiments
2013/07/05

Goals
1. Test acquisition of camera application with enhanced metadata
2. Collect sample material to assess accuracy of device sensors (i.e. GPS, IMU)
3. Acquire sample imagery for user experience testing
4. Acquire sample imagery for image processing tests

Location
Spencer Smith Park
Burlington, ON
Beginning at compass at west end of park
Ending at base of pier at east end of park

Experiments Conducted

1. Orientation Acquisition
- collect pictures from fixed location with varying orientation
- use center point of compass as fixed location
- first capture 4 cardinal directions
- capture additional 45 degree orientation images
- tests conducted by Denis (need to measure image acquisition height)
- tests started at approx 1:40 PM

2. Pitch Angle Tests (Building Tops)
- collect horizontal and pitched images to correlate building heights with angles
- capture horizontal shots of a distant tall building as a reference
- capture angled shot to center on closest corner of roof of tall buildings
- use building from different distances/depths
- tests conducted by Denis

3. GPS Positioning Accuracy - Fixed Orientation
- collect data to measure accuracy of system position (i.e. GPS)
- also can be used to measure GPS positional granularity
- traverse North-South line of compass from South to North
- acquire images perpendicular to line of travel (i.e. facing West)
- collect images in approximately 1 m increments (Denis side-step)
- tests conducted by Denis
- tests started at approx 1:47 PM

4. GPS Positioning Accuracy - Variable Orientation
- same as above but keep center of image fixed on static object
- used lamp post at SW corner of compass pad
- tests conducted by Denis
- tests started at approx 1:48 PM

5. 3D Orientation Testing
- fixed position of center of phone in 3D space
- change orientation about all axes to collect images with variable IMU data
- tests conducted by Arjun (need to measure image acquisition height)
- tests started at approx 1:51 PM

6. Distant Object Oblique Angle Testing
- use center of Burlington Skyway as image center
- also collect images with two other fixed points
- pictures taken along a long, straight line with varying angle
- begin at center of compass
- use lamp posts heading North-East to base of pier as waypoints
- can compare positions acquired to Google Maps image data
- note that image data may not be 100% accurate (offset)
- but we can measure fixed positional distances, variability in measurements
- tests conducted by Denis
- tests started at approx 1:57 PM

Summary of Results
- to be completed with results analysis
- summary of results captured in KML file posted on Trello

Future Recommendations
- tape measure to measure image acquisition height, distances
- pick location with Google Street View data
- any additional tests that need to be conducted?
